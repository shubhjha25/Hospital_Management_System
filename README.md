## Features
- Manages patient records (Add, Update, Delete, View).
- Handles doctor and staff details.
- Schedules and manages appointments.
- Implements transaction management for billing and payments.
- Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Logs database activities for debugging and tracking changes.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JDBC
- MySQL / PostgreSQL (or any other relational database)
